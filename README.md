# Toggle Sprint Display

A fabric mod that shows whether you're currently sprinting in your HUD. Meant for usage with toggle sprint but also
functional for hold sprint.

## Customisation

Using a resource pack you can modify the language files to modify the text shown in your HUD.
You can find the example values in [this file](https://github.com/Aeltumn/toggle-sprint-display/blob/main/src/main/resources/assets/toggle-sprint-display/lang/en_us.json).
